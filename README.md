This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About Me 
I am a second year Healthcare Policy & Management student here at Heinz. I was born and grew up in Pittsburgh so I am a true "Yinzer"! My pronouns are he, him and his. 

# What I Hope to Learn
Learning the best ways to display data to be able to define outcomes in easy to understand graphs/tables or tabular summaries. Upon graduation I will be working with large data sets and relaying the outcomes to my superiors. This class will help me tremendously in being able to showcase my outcomes and help my organization.
